"""End-to-end tests for the async sample routing path (EngineStateDB +
``SkyRLTrainInferenceForwardingClient``).

GPU-gated: requires at least one CUDA device. Spins up a real Tinker API
server with the SkyRL-Train Megatron backend in non-colocated mode so the
API process forwards sample requests directly to vLLM via the new path,
bypassing the engine subprocess's serial scheduling loop.

Coverage:
  - test_engine_state_published: after ``save_weights_for_sampler``, the
    engine's vLLM proxy URL is written to ``EngineStateDB``.
  - test_sample_uses_external_path: an issued sample creates a future of
    type ``EXTERNAL`` (not ``SAMPLE``) and resolves successfully.
  - test_sample_concurrent_with_training_is_fast: the central
    parallelism test. While a long-running stream of ``forward_backward``
    + ``optim_step`` calls is in flight, a sample request resolves in
    much less time than the training stream takes, demonstrating that
    sample latency is no longer bounded by training-step duration.
  - test_concurrent_samples_per_adapter: many concurrent samples across
    two adapters all resolve via the forwarding client's connection pool
    and per-adapter (``model=<model_id>``) routing on vLLM.
