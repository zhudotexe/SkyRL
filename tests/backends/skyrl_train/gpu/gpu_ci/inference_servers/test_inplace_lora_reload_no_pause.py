"""GPU integration tests for the no-pause multi-tenant LoRA weight-sync path.

These exercise the contract enforced in
``worker_dispatch.save_weights_for_sampler``: when the trainer is using
in-place LoRA adapters (multi-tenant), the weight sync is dispatched
without any ``pause_generation`` / ``resume_generation`` call — vLLM is
expected to swap LoRA tensors under in-flight requests without aborting
or corrupting them, and without disturbing other adapters' generations.

This test approximates weight sync by reloading adapters
from a different on-disk snapshot path with ``load_lora_adapter`` — the
end state on the engine (LoRA tensors for ``lora_name`` replaced
in-place, same ``lora_int_id``) is identical, and that is the surface
vLLM is supposed to make safe.

Tests:

1. ``test_inplace_lora_reload_during_inflight_does_not_corrupt`` — a long
   sample is in-flight against ``lora-target``; mid-flight we call
   ``load_lora_adapter("lora-target", <new path>)``. The request must
   complete with a non-abort stop reason and a non-empty token stream.

2. ``test_inplace_lora_reload_does_not_pause_other_lora`` — two adapters
   (Meow, Woof) are loaded; a long sample is in-flight against Woof. We
   reload Meow's weights mid-flight and assert that (a) the Woof sample
   completes with non-abort stop reason and the LoRA-shaped "woof"
   content, and (b) no global pause was issued on the inference engine
   (spied via ``pause_generation`` / ``resume_generation``).
