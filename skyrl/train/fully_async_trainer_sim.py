"""Simulated-trainer variant of the fully-async trainer (no trainer components).

``FullyAsyncTrainerSim`` reuses ``FullyAsyncRayPPOTrainer.train()`` as-is and overrides only
the model-dependent seams so that NO policy/critic/ref models are built and NO weights are
broadcast. Used to benchmark the generation/inference side (e.g. router load-balancing) on
large models without paying for trainer GPUs — typically pointed at already-served endpoints
via ``generator.inference_engine.external_proxy_url`` / ``external_server_urls``.

See ``FullyAsyncConfig.simulate_training`` and the
``examples/train/fully_async/main_fully_async_sim.py`` entrypoint.

    Faithfully reproduces the **generation-side** dynamics of real fully-async training —
    the staleness controller, capacity gating, rate limiting, generation-buffer fill, and the
    pause/resume around weight sync — but **instantiates no trainer components and broadcasts
    no weights**. Each step:
      1. waits for a full mini-batch in the generation buffer (consuming it),
      2. sleeps ``fully_async.simulate_training_step_seconds`` (stands in for fwd/bwd/optim),
      3. issues ``pause_generation`` → optional ``simulate_weight_sync_seconds`` sleep →
         ``resume_generation`` (a real step would broadcast new weights in between),
      4. advances ``global_step`` and notifies the staleness manager (unblocking generation).

    Designed to benchmark inference/router behavior (e.g. session-aware load balancing) on
    large models without paying for trainer GPUs. Typically pointed at **already-served**
    endpoints via ``generator.inference_engine.external_proxy_url`` /
    ``external_server_urls`` (with ``run_engines_locally=false``), so generation hits the live
    deployment directly. No models are built (the entrypoint skips ``build_models``), no
