Ray exports these to the same Prometheus that scrapes node GPU metrics, under the ``ray_`` prefix,
so loop phase and generation-buffer depth join GPU utilization on one wall-clock axis and survive a
cluster restart, e.g.

    avg(ray_node_gpus_utilization) and on() (ray_skyrl_training_phase{phase="eval"} == 1)
