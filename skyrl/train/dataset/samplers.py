"""Stateful samplers for :class:`~skyrl.train.sft_trainer.SFTTrainer`.

These samplers plug into ``torchdata.stateful_dataloader.StatefulDataLoader``
so the sampling position is captured in the dataloader's ``state_dict`` and
restored on resume. A sampler exposes ``state_dict``/``load_state_dict``; the
``StatefulDataLoader`` fast-forwards to the saved position when iteration
resumes after a checkpoint load.

Core ships :class:`StatefulSequentialSampler` (backing the ``sampler="sequential"``
config option) and :class:`DataMixingSampler` (weighted multi-source mixing, used
by default when multiple ``train_datasets`` are configured with ``sampler="random"``).
The ``sampler="custom"`` path loads a user-supplied sampler from
``SFTConfig.sampler_class_path`` via :func:`import_sampler_class`, instantiating
it as ``ClassName(tokenized, **sampler_kwargs)``. See
``examples/train/sft/curriculum_sampler.py`` for a reference custom sampler.

    The dataset is a concatenation of sources with sizes ``lengths`` (in order);
    ``weights`` gives a sampling weight per source. Per-example weights are set to
    ``weight_source / size_source`` so each *source* is sampled in proportion to
    its weight independent of its size.

    Each epoch draws a fresh plan of ``num_samples`` indices from a persistent
    generator seeded with ``seed``: exhausting the plan clears it, and the next
    ``iter()`` (the trainer re-creates the dataloader iterator at epoch
    boundaries) re-draws with the advanced generator state. ``state_dict``
    captures the cursor plus the generator state *as of the current plan's
    draw*, so a mid-epoch checkpoint resume reproduces the in-flight plan and
    all subsequent epochs match the uninterrupted run.

    Args:
        data_source: The (concatenated) training dataset; only its length is used.
        lengths: Size of each source, in the order they appear in the dataset.
        weights: Per-source sampling weight (need not sum to 1; relative scale matters).
        num_samples: Number of indices to emit per epoch. Defaults to
            ``len(data_source)``, so ``steps_per_epoch`` matches a single
            concatenated dataset of the same size.
        seed: Seed for the deterministic weighted draw.

            ``WeightedRandomSampler``; mixing across sources generally wants True).
