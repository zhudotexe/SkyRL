r"""BIRD SQL env for skyrl-gym, mirroring the verl PR #6 reward contract.

Single-turn env: the model emits a response containing one SQL query inside a
``<think>...</think>`` block followed by a ```` ```sql ... ``` ```` block (the
arctic_text_to_sql_r1 format). We hand the full response and the gold SQL +
per-sample SQLite path to ``.bird_reward.compute_score`` — the *same*
reward function the validated verl PR #6 run used — and surface its ``score``
field as the GRPO reward.

The reward function is vendored at
``integrations/arctic_rl/envs/bird_reward.py`` so the integration doesn't
depend on a private Arctic-Platform recipe branch.

Why a SkyRL-side env at all?  The Arctic RL server is reward-agnostic; reward
scoring runs client-side via skyrl-gym (see ``ArcticGenerator.generate``).
This keeps the protocol simple (server takes (sequences, rewards, loss_mask))
and lets us reuse verl PR #6's reward function unmodified.

Required ``extras`` (forwarded automatically by ``PromptDataset`` from the
verl-format parquet — no schema rewriting needed):

  - ``reward_model.ground_truth`` : gold SQL string
  - ``extra_info.db_path``        : absolute path to the SQLite DB file
  - ``extra_info``                : passed through to ``compute_score``
                                    as the ``extra_info`` arg (it needs
                                    ``db_path`` and optionally
                                    ``alternative_answers``).
  - ``data_source``               : passed through (used by some reward fns
                                    for routing; benign for BIRD).
