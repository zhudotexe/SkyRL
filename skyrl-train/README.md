> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note:** SkyRL is undergoing a repo reorganization into the `SkyRL/skyrl` folder, which unifies the skyrl libraries (`skyrl-train`, `skyrl-tx`) into a single package. The code that was previously in the `skyrl-train` package can now be found in `skyrl/{backends/, train/, utils/}`. See issue: https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL/issues/1145


# Overview

 With a focus on modularity, `skyrl-train` makes it easy to prototype new training algorithms, environments, and execution plans—without compromising usability or speed. 

`skyrl-train` is **for users who want to modify anything:**

- **Quickly develop new environments** without modifying or understanding the training code.
- **Modify the training execution plan** such as model placement, colocation or disaggregation of training and generation, and async RL.
- **Implement custom trajectory generation** specific to your use-case, such as custom sampling methods, tree search, etc.
- … make any other flexible modifications to the RL workflow!


## Key Features
The `skyrl-train` package supports:
- PPO and GRPO
- Training Backends: FSDP and [Megatron](https://docs.skyrl.ai/docs/examples/megatron)
- Inference backends: vLLM, SGLang, and any custom OpenAI API compatible endpoint that exposes a method to perform weight sync
- Ulysses sequence parallelism for long-context training
- [Colocated or disaggregated](https://docs.skyrl.ai/docs/configuration/placement) training and generation (including on heterogeneous hardware)
- Synchronous RL, [async one-off pipelining](https://docs.skyrl.ai/docs/tutorials/one_step_off_async), or [fully async RL with in-flight weight updates](https://docs.skyrl.ai/docs/tutorials/fully_async)
- Simple batched rollouts or Asynchronous rollouts for multi-turn conversations
- Weight sync via NCCL, gloo, or checkpoint-and-load
- Integration with `skyrl-gym`, [verifiers](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL/tree/main/examples/train_integrations/verifiers), [OpenEnv](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL/tree/main/examples/train_integrations/openenv), [Harbor/Terminal-Bench](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL/tree/main/examples/train_integrations/harbor), and more!
- Sequence packing and Flash Attention 2
- Algorithmic support for RLOO, REINFORCE, GSPO, CISPO, SAPO
- Step-wise training for fully on policy multi-turn RL
- 5D Parallelism support for MoE models with the [Megatron backend](https://docs.skyrl.ai/docs/examples/megatron)

## Documentation

Find documentation at: [docs.skyrl.ai/docs/](https://docs.skyrl.ai/docs/)

## Quick Start

A quick start guide for installation and your first training run is provided below.

### Requirements

The only requirements are:

- CUDA version 12.8
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

If you're running on an existing Ray cluster, make sure to use Ray 2.56.0 and Python 3.12. If not, proceed with the installation instructions below.


First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL
cd SkyRL/
```

Then, create a new virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
# creates a venv at .venv/
uv sync --extra fsdp 
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, prepare the dataset:

```bash
uv run -- python examples/train/gsm8k/gsm8k_dataset.py
```

Finally, before training, make sure to configure Ray to use `uv`:

```bash
export RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_HOOK=ray._private.runtime_env.uv_runtime_env_hook.hook
# or add to your .bashrc
# echo 'export RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_HOOK=ray._private.runtime_env.uv_runtime_env_hook.hook' >> ~/.bashrc
```

You should now be able to run our example script (assumes at least 4 GPUs):

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=<your wandb api key>
bash examples/train/gsm8k/run_gsm8k.sh
```

For detailed installation instructions, as well as more examples, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.skyrl.ai/docs/).

## Training on a new task or environment

To implement a new task or environment using the SkyRL-Gym interface, please see our [Walkthrough Docs](https://docs.skyrl.ai/docs/tutorials/new_env).

If you don't want to use the SkyRL-Gym interface, or you have an existing task or agentic pipeline implementation and just want to train with it on top of SkyRL, we recommend you create a simple custom [`Generator`](/skyrl/train/generators/base.py), which requires implementing a single method, `generate()`. We have one example of a custom Generator at [`SkyRLGymGenerator`](/skyrl/train/generators/skyrl_gym_generator.py) which executes environments written in the SkyRL-Gym interface. We are working to provide more example integrations of agent harnesses -- please reach out if you'd like yours to be one of them!

## Reproducing SkyRL-SQL
We also test SkyRL by reproducing our prior release [SkyRL-SQL](https://novasky-ai.notion.site/skyrl-sql), which enabled efficient Multi-Turn RL for Text2SQL. 
You can find a link to the wandb report [here](https://wandb.ai/sky-posttraining-uc-berkeley/skyrl-sql/reports/SkyRL-SQL---VmlldzoxMzM0MTAyMw), and a detailed walk through of the reproduction in our [documentation](https://docs.skyrl.ai/docs/examples/multi_turn_text2sql).
