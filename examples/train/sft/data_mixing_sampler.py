"""Reference custom sampler: weighted data mixing for ``SFTTrainer``.

Like ``curriculum_sampler.py``, this is an *example* of a user-supplied stateful
sampler plugged into ``SFTTrainer`` via ``sampler=custom`` -- it is intentionally
NOT part of the core library. Point ``sampler_class_path`` at this class via a
dotted path importable from the repo root (run from the repo root; no
``__init__.py`` needed thanks to namespace packages), passing the sampler
config as overrides on the base SFT example script::

    bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_megatron.sh \
        sampler=custom \
        sampler_class_path=examples.train.sft.data_mixing_sampler.DataMixingSampler \
        'sampler_kwargs={lengths: [80, 20], weights: [0.5, 0.5], num_samples: 40, seed: 42}'

(``lengths`` must sum to the dataset size -- 100 for the script's
``train[:100]`` split -- and ``num_samples`` should be
``num_steps * batch_size``.)

Note: the import happens inside a Ray task, which does not inherit the driver's
``PYTHONPATH`` -- so the path must resolve from the worker's ``sys.path``
(which includes the repo root when launching from it).

It mixes a concatenation of sources (``ConcatDataset([src_a, src_b, ...])``)
according to per-source ``weights``, using torch's native
``WeightedRandomSampler`` for the weighted draw. Because each source's weight is
divided across its examples, the *source-level* mixing proportion matches
``weights`` regardless of how many examples each source has.

class DataMixingSampler(torch.utils.data.Sampler[int]):
    """Weighted multi-source sampler built on ``WeightedRandomSampler``.

    The dataset is a concatenation of sources with sizes ``lengths`` (in order);
    ``weights`` gives a sampling weight per source. Per-example weights are set to
    ``weight_source / size_source`` so each *source* is sampled in proportion to
    its weight independent of its size. A deterministic plan of ``num_samples``
    indices is materialized up front from ``seed`` via
    ``torch.utils.data.WeightedRandomSampler``, so iteration is reproducible and a
    single ``position`` cursor is sufficient for checkpoint/resume.

    Args:
        data_source: The (concatenated) training dataset; only its length is used.
        lengths: Size of each source, in the order they appear in the dataset.
        weights: Per-source sampling weight (need not sum to 1; relative scale matters).
        num_samples: Total number of indices to emit. Set to
            ``num_steps * batch_size`` to cover the whole run in one pass (keeps
            the sampler state intact across epoch boundaries and makes resume
            bit-exact across the entire run). Defaults to ``len(data_source)``.
        seed: Seed for the deterministic weighted draw.
        replacement: Whether to sample with replacement (passed through to
            ``WeightedRandomSampler``; mixing across sources generally wants True).
