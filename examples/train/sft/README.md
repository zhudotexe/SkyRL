# SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) Example

This example demonstrates supervised fine-tuning using SkyRL, with support for both FSDP and Megatron backends.

## Dataset

By default, the example uses the [Alpaca-Cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahma/alpaca-cleaned) dataset (`yahma/alpaca-cleaned`). No manual download is required -- the dataset is loaded automatically via HuggingFace `datasets`.

You can switch to a different dataset by overriding `train_datasets` and `train_dataset_splits` on the command line, or train on a weighted mixture of several datasets (see [Multi-dataset training](#multi-dataset-training-and-evaluation)). The singular `dataset_name`/`dataset_split` (and `eval_dataset_name`/`eval_dataset_split`) fields are deprecated: they still work but emit a `DeprecationWarning` and are translated to the list form internally.

### Pretokenized datasets

If your data pipeline tokenizes offline, point the trainer directly at the pretokenized store to skip
online tokenization (`tokenize_chat_example` / `tokenize_sft_example`) entirely:

```bash
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_megatron.sh \
    "pretokenized_dataset_paths=['$HOME/data/tokenized-train']" \
    "eval_pretokenized_dataset_paths=['$HOME/data/tokenized-eval']"  # optional
```

Each entry of `pretokenized_dataset_paths` is a local path to a file or directory in any of these formats
(auto-detected): Parquet, JSON-lines, raw Arrow IPC files, or a HuggingFace `Dataset.save_to_disk` directory.
Like `train_datasets`, multiple stores are concatenated and mixed per `train_dataset_weights`; multiple eval
stores are evaluated separately under `eval/{name}/`, with names from `eval_dataset_names` (defaulting to each
path's basename).

Each row must contain:

- `input_ids` — unpadded token ids for the full sequence (SkyRL pads at collation time);
- `loss_mask` — full-sequence 0/1 mask, same length as `input_ids`: 1 on tokens to compute loss on;
- for VLM data: `pixel_values` and `image_grid_thw` (Qwen-style image tensors, stored as nested lists).

```python
# Instruction-following: 3 prompt tokens, loss on the 2 response tokens.
{"input_ids": [5091, 374, 220, 8949, 13], "loss_mask": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}

# Multi-turn: loss on every assistant turn; 0s on the user turn between them.
{"input_ids": [5091, 374, 8949, 220, 748], "loss_mask": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]}
```

Rows are normalized to the trainer's internal format; `max_length` truncation still applies (rows whose loss
window is fully truncated are dropped, and over-length VLM rows are always dropped rather than truncated).

Pretokenized stores are **memory-mapped, not loaded into RAM**: schema validation runs eagerly at load time
(vectorized, so malformed stores still fail fast), while row normalization happens lazily at access time.
Controller memory stays bounded by the OS page cache regardless of dataset size, and the store files must stay
on disk for the duration of the run. Set `dataloader_num_workers>=2` so the per-batch normalization is
prefetched off the training critical path (measured: ~11 ms/step exposed at `dataloader_num_workers=0` vs
~1 ms hidden with 2 workers, against multi-second train steps).
`pretokenized_dataset_paths` cannot be combined with `train_datasets` (nor `eval_pretokenized_dataset_paths`
with `eval_datasets`) — a run either tokenizes online or ingests pretokenized stores. See
[`skyrl/train/dataset/pretokenized.py`](../../../skyrl/train/dataset/pretokenized.py) for details.

## Quickstart

### FSDP (single GPU)

```bash
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_fsdp.sh
```

Trains `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` on 1 GPU with FSDP. Key defaults: max length 512, batch size 4, 10 training steps.

### Megatron (multi-GPU with TP/PP)

```bash
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_megatron.sh
```

Trains `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` on 4 GPUs with Megatron (TP=2, PP=2). Key defaults: max length 512, batch size 4, 10 training steps.

### VLM SFT (Megatron, multi-GPU)

```bash
# One-time: build a small messages-format dataset from HuggingFaceM4/the_cauldron
uv run examples/train/sft/prepare_cauldron_vlm.py --output-dir $HOME/data/cauldron-vlm

bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_megatron_vlm.sh
```

Fine-tunes the vision-language model `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct` on 4 GPUs with the Megatron backend (pure DP=4 by default). Scale to larger models by overriding `megatron_config.tensor_model_parallel_size` / `pipeline_model_parallel_size`.

VLM SFT mirrors the constraints of the FSDP VLM RL path (3D RoPE + image-token positions tie image tensors to specific sequence positions), so the following are required and enforced:

- `remove_microbatch_padding=false` — no microbatch padding / sequence packing.
- `megatron_config.sequence_parallel_size=1` and `megatron_config.context_parallel_size=1`.
- `train_on_what=last_assistant_message` — VLM tokenization only supports last-assistant training.

Mixed text+image batches are not supported: every sample in a VLM batch must carry image(s). The dataset must use the chat `messages` format with image content encoded as `{"type": "image", "image": <data-uri>}` (see `prepare_cauldron_vlm.py`).

### LoRA (FSDP, single GPU)

```bash
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_lora.sh
```

Trains `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` with LoRA adapters (rank 32, alpha 16) on 1 GPU using FSDP. Only adapter parameters are trainable, significantly reducing memory usage. Key defaults: max length 512, batch size 4, 10 training steps, sample packing enabled. Override LoRA settings with e.g. `model.lora.rank=64 model.lora.alpha=32`.

All scripts accept extra overrides as positional arguments:

```bash
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_megatron.sh num_steps=20 batch_size=8
```

## Dummy/Benchmarking Mode

For profiling throughput or verifying the training pipeline without real data, use the dummy-run scripts. These fabricate full-context random sequences and skip dataset loading.

```bash
# FSDP dummy run
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_dummy_fsdp.sh

# Megatron dummy run
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_dummy_megatron.sh
```

Override the number of steps with:

```bash
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_dummy_megatron.sh dummy_run_max_steps=10
```

## Entrypoint

The SFT trainer is invoked as a module:

```bash
python -m skyrl.train.main_sft [key=value overrides...]
```

See [`skyrl/train/main_sft.py`](../../../skyrl/train/main_sft.py) for the CLI entrypoint and
[`skyrl/train/sft_trainer.py`](../../../skyrl/train/sft_trainer.py) for the full implementation.

## Minibatch packing (controller-level FFD, Megatron only)

When `use_sequence_packing=true`, `SFTTrainer` collates with
`PackedDataCollator` instead of `DefaultCollator`. Every training step:

1. The controller's collator runs FFD bin-packing over the global
   mini-batch using `max_length` as the bin capacity.
2. The bin count is forced to a multiple of `dp_size` via empty-bin
   padding (`min_bin_count`/`bin_count_multiple` knobs in
   [`bin_packing._adjust_bin_count`](../../../skyrl/train/dataset/bin_packing.py)).
3. Each bin becomes one row of the dispatched `TrainingInputBatch`. SkyRL additionally
   tracks some metadata for demarcating sequences.

Example overrides on top of `run_sft_megatron_tulu3_50k.sh`:

```bash
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_megatron_tulu3_50k.sh \
    use_sequence_packing=true \
    max_tokens_per_microbatch=4096
```


## Samplers and the stateful dataloader

`SFTTrainer` feeds the training loop from a
[`torchdata.stateful_dataloader.StatefulDataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/data/main/stateful_dataloader.html).
The sampling position is written into each checkpoint (`data.pt`) so a
`resume_from` run continues from the exact next example of the in-progress
epoch.

Three sampler strategies are built in:

- `sampler=random` (default) — reshuffles every epoch using `seed`. The
  in-progress epoch resumes bit-exactly; later epochs are re-shuffled into a
  valid (but not byte-identical) order, matching the RL trainer's behavior.
  With multiple `train_datasets` this strategy switches to weighted per-source
  mixing (see [Multi-dataset training](#multi-dataset-training-and-evaluation)).
- `sampler=sequential` — iterates the dataset in order
  ([`StatefulSequentialSampler`](../../../skyrl/train/dataset/samplers.py)).
- `sampler=custom` — loads your own stateful sampler from `sampler_class_path`,
  instantiated as `ClassName(tokenized, **sampler_kwargs)`. A custom sampler
  only needs `__iter__`/`__len__` plus `state_dict`/`load_state_dict` to be
  checkpointable. The import runs inside a Ray task, which does **not** inherit
  the driver's `PYTHONPATH` -- use a dotted path importable from the repo root
  (e.g. `examples.train.sft.curriculum_sampler.CurriculumLearningSampler`) and
  launch from the repo root. No `__init__.py` is needed (namespace packages).

### Curriculum learning example

[`curriculum_sampler.py`](curriculum_sampler.py) is a reference custom sampler
(`CurriculumLearningSampler`) that walks through difficulty-ordered subsets,
progressively unlocking harder data. Order the dataset easy→hard and give the
per-stage `lengths`. Set `num_samples=num_steps*batch_size` so the whole
schedule is covered in a single pass (this keeps the curriculum state intact
across epoch boundaries and makes resume bit-exact across the entire run).
Pass the sampler config as overrides on the base SFT example script, run from
the repo root so the dotted path resolves (`lengths` must sum to the dataset
size — 100 for the script's `train[:100]` split — and `num_samples` should be
`num_steps * batch_size` to cover the whole schedule):

```bash
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_megatron.sh \
    sampler=custom \
    sampler_class_path=examples.train.sft.curriculum_sampler.CurriculumLearningSampler \
    'sampler_kwargs={lengths: [34, 33, 33], num_samples: 40, seed: 42}'
```

## Multi-dataset training and evaluation

Training on a weighted mixture of datasets is built in: pass lists to
`train_datasets`/`train_dataset_splits`:

```bash
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_megatron_multi_dataset.sh
# or directly:
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_megatron.sh \
    train_datasets="['allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture','yahma/alpaca-cleaned']" \
    train_dataset_splits="['train[:50000]','train[:10000]']" \
    train_dataset_weights="[0.8,0.2]"
```

Each dataset is tokenized (and cached) independently, then concatenated. With
multiple datasets and the default `sampler=random`, batches are drawn with
weighted per-source sampling (see
[`samplers.py`](../../../skyrl/train/dataset/samplers.py)):
`train_dataset_weights` gives the approximate per-batch ratio of samples from
each source, **independent of the dataset sizes** (a 1k-example dataset with
weight 0.5 contributes half of every batch even when mixed with a 1M-example
one). Weights default to equal mixing (`1/N`). The sampler draws a fresh
weighted plan every epoch and stores its RNG state in the checkpoint, so
`resume_from` reproduces the exact sample stream. All datasets must share the
same `messages_key`/`tools_key`/`system_key` columns and modality (all-text or
all-image).

Evaluation similarly accepts multiple datasets, each evaluated separately with
its loss logged under `eval/{name}/loss`:

```bash
    eval_datasets="['allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture','yahma/alpaca-cleaned']" \
    eval_dataset_splits="['train[-500:]','train[200:700]']" \
    eval_dataset_names="[tulu3,alpaca]"
```

`eval_dataset_names` is optional (defaults to the dataset name with `/`
replaced by `_`) and only affects metric names. **Note (breaking):** eval
metrics are now always nested per dataset -- the former `eval/eval_loss` key is
`eval/{name}/loss`, even with a single eval dataset.

### Custom samplers over multiple datasets

A custom sampler still controls the mixture however it likes (e.g. mixing
weights that change as training progresses). With multiple `train_datasets`,
the trainer injects the tokenized per-dataset `lengths` into `sampler_kwargs`
(user-supplied `lengths` win), so the constructor must accept a `lengths`
kwarg. Explicit `train_dataset_weights` are rejected outside `sampler=random`
-- pass your ratios through `sampler_kwargs` instead:

```bash
bash examples/train/sft/run_sft_megatron.sh \
    train_datasets="['allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture','yahma/alpaca-cleaned']" \
    train_dataset_splits="['train[:80]','train[:20]']" \
    sampler=custom \
    sampler_class_path=examples.train.sft.curriculum_sampler.CurriculumLearningSampler \
    'sampler_kwargs={num_samples: 40, seed: 42}'
```

(Here the curriculum sampler treats the concatenated datasets as its
difficulty-ordered stages via the injected `lengths`.)

## Limitations

- **Limited `train_on_what` options**: Supports training on all or the last assistant message.
- **Two data formats only.** Supports chat-template (`messages` column) and Alpaca (`instruction`/`output` columns). Raw pre-tokenized or plain-text continuation formats are not supported.
